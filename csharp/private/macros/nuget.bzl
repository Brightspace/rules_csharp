    Rather than downloading the package over HTTP from a package source, an
    extracted package directory or a .nupkg file can be used. These may be
    checked into your repository within your workspace, or somewhere else on
    your disk.

    Exactly one of either the dir or file arguments must be provided. They can
    either be a relative path in the workspace, or an absolute path. Note that
    paths on Windows use forward slashes.

    At most one of build_file or build_file_content may be provided. If neither
    are, a default BUILD file will be used that makes a "best effort" to wire
    up the package. See docs/UsingNuGetPacakges.md for more info.

    Args:
      name: A unique name for the package's workspace.
      dir: A directory containing an extracted package.
      file: A path to a nupkg file
      build_file: The path to a BUILD file to use for the package.
      build_file_content: A string containing the contents of a BUILD file.
      sha256: The SHA256 of the package.

        reproducibility.
